Dear <%=h @user.full_name %>,

Your role as <%=h @removed_role.name %> in project <%= h @project.presentation_name %> has been removed.

<%- if !@roles.empty? -%>
You still are assigned to this project as <%=h @roles.map {|r| r.name}.join(', ') %>.
<%- else -%>
Since that was only role you had in that project you're no longer assigned to it.
<%- end -%>

Please contact any admin of your domain if you believe it was made by mistake.

<%= mail_footer(:user => @user, :display_spam_info => true) %>
