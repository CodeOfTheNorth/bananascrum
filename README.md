Banana Scrum - a Rails based Scrum tool

This is the software that was powering the online Banana Scrum (www.bananascrum.com) 2008-2015 in the single-domain version (that was also sold as a standalone compiled tool). It is now open sourced - feel free to download, use and develop it further. 

The online Banana Scrum has been shut down on Dec 29th 2015 and is not going back. All data from user accounts was preserved and can be obtained by writing to info@codesprinters.com with an appropriate request.
