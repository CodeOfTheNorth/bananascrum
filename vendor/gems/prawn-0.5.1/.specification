summary: A fast and nimble PDF generator for Ruby
post_install_message: "\n  Welcome to Prawn, the best pure-Ruby PDF solution ever!\n\
  \  This is version 0.5.1\n   \n  For those coming from Prawn 0.4.x or earlier, note \
  that this release has\n  several API breaking changes as well as many new features.\n\
  \n  For details on what has changed, see:\n    http://wiki.github.com/sandal/prawn/changelog\n\
  \n  If you have questions, contact us at:\n    http://groups.google.com/group/prawn-ruby\n\
  \n  To submit a patch or report a bug: \n    http://github.com/sandal/prawn\n\n\
  \  Prawn is meant for experienced Ruby hackers, so if you are new to Ruby, you\n\
  \  might want to wait until you've had some practice with the language before\n  \
  expecting Prawn to work for you.  Things may change after 1.0, but for now\n  if \
  you're not ready to read source code and patch bugs or missing features \n  yourself \
  (with our help), Prawn might not be the right fit.\n\n  But if you know what you're \
  getting yourself into, enjoy!\n  "
