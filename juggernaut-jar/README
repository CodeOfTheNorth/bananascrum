This directory contains all files and dependencies that are neccessary to
build standalone juggernaut server that can be run from single jar archive.

To build the executable jar file,
- rake
This places the livesync.jar artifact in the pkg directory.

To run the application from the filesystem,
- rake run

To run the application from the jar,
- java -jar livesync.jar -c path/to/config/file.yml
You should be able to run this from anywhere on your filesystem; you don't need to be in the same directory.

If you don't have config file you can generate sample one with
- java -jar livesync.jar -g output_file.yml
